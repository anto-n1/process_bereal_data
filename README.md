# BeReal Photo Organizer  

I created this program after I stopped using [BeReal](https://bereal.com), but I still wanted to keep my photos. I requested my data from BeReal, and they sent me all my photos along with some metadata. However, the photos were not sorted and had unclear filenames, making it difficult to organize them properly.  

This script automatically renames and organizes your BeReal photos based on the date they were taken. It also saves the captions in separate text files.  

Feel free to suggest improvements or ask any questions! ðŸ˜Š
